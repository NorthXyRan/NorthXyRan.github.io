  abstract: "Open-ended Structured Questions (OSQ) assess not only students' knowledge but also their reasoning and expression. However, grading OSQ requires fine-grained, scoring point-level analysis, which is labor-intensive and difficult to scale. Although recent LLM-based and human-AI collaborative grading systems improve efficiency, they mainly operate at the whole-response level and lack support for point-level inspection, correction, and feedback integration. We present VeriGrader, a novel human-Al collaborative system for OSQ grading. It combines chain-of-thought prompting with scoring point- and response-level in-context learning to enable interpretable LLM grading and iterative refinement from instructor feedback. A coordinated multi-view interface supports efficient verification of response segments, matched scoring points, and rationales. We evaluate VeriGrader using real course data and a user study with 12 participants. Results show that VeriGrader improves both grading efficiency, accuracy, and consistency over the baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of VeriGrader and promoting human-Al collaboration in educational assessment."
